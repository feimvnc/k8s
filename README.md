-minikube 
-virtual box 
-vagrant
-vmware fusion 

# My setup 
For home lab setup, running linux and k8s commands (kubeadm, kubectl), using chrome ssh to vms, run tmux, and get the feeling of linux, personally I used the following:

Hardware
-macbook pro, 2018, 15-inch, 6-core Intel, 32 GB memmory, worked quite well, only wish longer battery hours  

Software 

-vmware fusion

free personal use, email registration / key required, no need to update host os config, also good to have other vm of fedora, centos to try docker, go lang, rust, ebpf projects
like the Virtual Machine Libray view
no vm clone option, search ubuntu

-ubuntu 

free open source, tried 18.04, 20.04, 22.04.1 (new version for ebpf and support of new kernel 5.15.x)
suggest install the version which match matching k8s certification cluster,
